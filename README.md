# Community tutorial.

The Community mobile app is an app where users can create Threads and then add Comments. We want users to be able to upload profile pictures either using their mobile Camera or their Photo albums and display their personal information. Also we want to add a specific View that displays info regarding the Forum app.
Only authenticated users can view/create Threads or Comments or in other words, only authenticated users may use the Community app.
